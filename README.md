go-fish - Yet another Go REPL (read, eval, print loop)
============================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rocky/go-fish.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rocky/go-fish)

This project provides an interactive environment for evaluating go
expressions.

Yeah, we know of some others. I think this one has more promise. The
heavy lifting for eval is provided by the Carl Chatfield's
[eval](https://github.com/0xfaded/eval) package.

Setup
-----

* Make sure our Go environment is setup, e.g. *$GOBIN*, *$GOPATH*, ...
* Make sure you have a version 1.2ish Go installed.

```
   $ go get github.com/rocky/go-fish
   $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/rocky/go-fish
   $ make install  # or look at Makefile
```

If you have
[go-gnureadline](https://code.google.com/p/go-gnureadline/) installed
and want the GNU readline support. In addition to the above try:

```
   $ make go-fish-grl
   $ make install
```

If you have [remake](https://github.com/rocky/remake) installed, you can change *make* above to *remake -x* to see the simple *go* and shell commands that get run. (And *remake --tasks* is also your friend.)

Using
-----

Run `go-fish` or `go-fish-grl`. For now, we have only a static
environment provided and that's exactly the environment that *go-fish*
uses for itself. (In other words this is ideally suited to introspect
about itself). Since it uses *eval* and that package is a reasonable size program,
many of the packages like *os*, *fmt*, *strconv*, *errors*, *exec*, etc. are
available. Look at the import list in file *repl_imports.go* for the
exact list, or type *pkgs* inside *go-fish* (as shown below) for a list.

Two global variables have been defined: *env*, and *results*. *env*
the environment that is defined, again largely by
*eval_imports.go*. As you enter expresions, the results are saved in
slice *results*. To quit, enter `Ctrl-D` (EOF) or the word `quit`.

Here's a sample session:

```console
$ ./go-fish
== A simple Go eval REPL ==

Results of expression are stored in variable slice "results".
The environment is stored in global variable "env".

Enter expressions to be evaluated at the "gofish>" prompt.

To see all results, type: "results".

To quit, enter: "quit" or Ctrl-D (EOF).
To get help, enter: "help".
gofish> 10+len("abc" + "def")
Kind = Type = int
results[0] = 16
gofish> os.Stderr
os.Stderr
Kind = ptr
Type = *os.File
results[1] = &{0x1882d120}
gofish> fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, os.Getenv("GOPATH"))
/home/rocky/go
Kind = Multi-Value
